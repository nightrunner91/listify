# Listify  

**Listify** is a lightweight, modern web application that helps you organize and track your favorite **Games, TV Shows, Films, Anime, Manga, Books, and Music** — all in one place.  

Data is stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`, with easy **export/import in JSON format**, so you stay in control of your library.  

🚀 Listify is the next evolution of [Nightlist](https://github.com/nightrunner91/nightlist), rebuilt from the ground up with **Vue 3**, **Vite**, and a refined, user-friendly interface powered by **Naive UI**.
