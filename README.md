# Listify üìù

This is an application for keeping track of lists of games, TV shows, movies and books of the user. It works with the browser's localStorage with the ability to export and import data in JSON format. Listify is an evolution of a previous project called [Nightlist](https://github.com/nightrunner91/nightlist), made on Vue 2. The new version uses modern technologies - [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and an updated design aimed at improving the user's UX.
