## Listify

This is an application designed to help users keep track of their favorite Games, TV Shows, Films, Anime, Manga, Books and Music.

The app uses the browser's localStorage to store data and provides the ability to export and import data in JSON format. 

Listify is an upgraded version of a previous project called [Nightlist](https://github.com/nightrunner91/nightlist), which was built using Vue 2. The new version uses modern technologies such as [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) (with Composition API), Vite, and an updated interface aimed at enhancing the user experience. For the UI design, I utilized the modern Vue 3 component library [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/en-US/), which is currently regarded as one of the best libraries available.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
